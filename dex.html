     <p>Dough's menu is carefully curated to bring customers a selection of flavors and textures to satisfy different tastes and cravings.</p><br>
      <p>Our doughnuts are made with a brioche-type dough prepared in small batches throughout the day so our customers can always get the freshest doughnuts possible! We offer many different flavors and try to keep our most popular available year round while others rotate and change seasonally.</p><br>
      <p>While we are working on bringing lots of new types of doughnuts including cake doughnuts and churros, we invite you to try our deliciously addictive Doughkas as the newest addition to our menu. Inspired by the Babka, twisted yeast loaves of Eastern European Jewish tradition, Doughkas are made with our signature doughnut dough. For now, the Doughkas are only available at our Flatiron location but can be ordered in advance for pick up at our Bed Stuy location as well.</p><br>

      <h3 class="fpq">DO YOU USE SOY? PEANUTS? CORN? ARTIFICIAL COLORS??</h3>
      <p>While we do not use soy, peanuts, or corn in any of our base doughs, they are occasionally used in our glazes and fills. Therefore, we can not guarantee that our products are absolutely free of any of these ingredients. While we offer some options for folks with dietary restrictions, we can not guarantee that our products are completely free of bacon, nuts, gluten, eggs, or other allergens as we use these products regularly in the kitchen. </p>

      <p>Vegan” means made without ingredients sourced from animals (dairy, meat, eggs, honey). Many of our doughnuts are vegan (about 85% of them) - however, we are not an exclusively vegan bakery and our treats may not be suitable for folks who, for ethical reasons, choose not to eat products which may have come in contact with animal products.  </p> <p>To find our vegan treats, look for the ⓥ indicator on our menu board and case labels. </p>

      <h3 class="fpq">DO YOU PROVIDE NUTRITION INFORMATION / LABELS?</h3>
      <p>We take pride in having developed all our own recipes and are particular about choosing high quality ingredients in the production of our treats. As a small scale bakery serving ready-to-eat products, we are not required by the FDA to undertake the expense of developing nutrition labels for our products. Our bakers and baristas are happy to answer basic questions about ingredients in our scratch-made products so that folks with food allergies and dietary restrictions are able to select products to fit their particular needs.</p>
